# Liquibase Online Meetup

We will be having our first meetup 2009-6-25 at 12:00 PM US central time (GMT-5) using the "Chat" functionality of the Liquibase community forum (<a href="https://forum.liquibase.org/" target="_blank">https://forum.liquibase.org/</a>). To log in, you will need to be registered.


I will be there to discuss the upcoming 2.0 release, development processes, outstanding issues and feature requests, and anything else of interest to participants. Planned time is 1 hour.


Hope to see you there.
