# Exerimental Amazon Redshift Support

A new Liquibase-Redshift extension is now available at <a href="https://github.com/liquibase/liquibase-redshift">https://github.com/liquibase/liquibase-redshift</a>. If you are interested in trying out Liquibase with Amazon Redshift, give it a try and let me know how well it works.

You can download the most recent builds from the "releases" tab.
