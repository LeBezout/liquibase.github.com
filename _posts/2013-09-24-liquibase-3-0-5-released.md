# Liquibase 3.0.5 Released

### Performance


The major focus of this release is performance improvements:


- Startup time is significantly improved for larger databases
- Preconditions now snapshot far less of the database
- Running generateChangeLog on a test MySQL database with over 4000 tables went from crashing after an hour to completing in 30 seconds. Even an Oracle database with the same structure finished in a couple minutes.



If you are still seeing any unexpected performance problems, <a href="https://liquibase.jira.com/browse/CORE">file a bug report</a>



You can download 3.0.5 from <a href="http://liquibase.org/download">http://liquibase.org/download</a> and through the maven repository system once it gets mirrored through. If you have any questions or problems, visit the <a href="http://liquibase.org/community">forums or bug tracker</a>


### Notable Bugs


- Multi-column foreign keys are snapshotted correctly now
- Improved case-sensitive/insensitive handling



### Potential Gotchas



Three bug fixes related to data type translations went into 3.0.5 which may cause issues for people that had been relying on incorrect behavior


- MS  SQLServer "DATE" columns are now translated to "DATE" rather than SMALLDATETIME
- MySQL TIMESTAMP columns are now nullable if you do not specify that they should be not null
- H2 and HSQL CLOB columns are now translated as CLOB rather than LONGVARCHAR
