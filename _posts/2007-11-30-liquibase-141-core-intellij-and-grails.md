# Liquibase 1.4.1 

Liquibase Core 1.4.1 has been released. This is primarily a bug fix release.

Upgrading is simply a matter of replacing the liquibase.jar file.

Download Liquibase Core 1.4.1 from:

The IntelliJ plug-in has also been updated to support 1.4.1.  It can be installed or updated through the IntelliJ plug-in manager.

The Grails plug-in has also been updated to support 1.4.1.  It is installed through the standard grails plug-in infrastructure.

As usual, let me know of any issues or suggestions you have questions.
