# Liquibase 3.8.6 Released

Liquibase 3.8.6 is now available here through [Liquibase.org](https://download.liquibase.org/download-community/). The [3.8.6 release is also available on GitHub](https://github.com/liquibase/liquibase/releases/). Here’s a closer look at what's included in the latest release.

## Liquibase 3.8.6 Overview

### Introducing Targeted Rollbacks for Liquibase Pro with 'rollbackOneChangeset' command
You asked, and we listened! With the release of Liquibase 3.8.6, Liquibase Pro users will now have additional rollback capabilities with Targeted Rollback, a powerful new feature that allows you to target one `changeSet` to rollback, without affecting all the other `changeSets` which followed it. Think "git cherry pick" for rollbacks.

We even added a helper command "rollbackOneChangsetSQL", which will show you the SQL that will be used in the rollbackOneChangeset command.

You can now also receive command specific help for Targeted Rollback by typing in either
`liquibase rollbackOneChangeSet --help` or 
`liquibase rollbackOneChangeSetSql --help`.

### Bug Fixes
Liquibase 3.8.6 also continues our initiative to re-engage with our users by bringing new bug fixes to our Liquibase platform. For both Liquibase Community and Liquibase Pro users, the following bugs were fixed in version 3.8.6:
- `excludeObjects`& `includeObjects` parameters now works correctly when running `diff`.
- `dataOutputDirectory` parameter will now specify statement csv files appropriately.
- Liquibase no longer required a `org.gjt.mm.mysql.Driver` property when using MySQL.
