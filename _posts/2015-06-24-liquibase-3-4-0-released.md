# Liquibase 3.4.0 Released

Liquibase 3.4.0 has been released and is working it's way through the Maven mirrors.

Downloads are available at [http://liquibase.org/download](/download). Question or comments can be directed [here](http://liquibase.org/community)


Lots of good things in 3.4.0, but some highlights include:

### You can now save snapshots and later reuse them for diff, generateChangeLog, and more

We previously added the ability to use "offline" databases which allows you to specify a url of "offline:mysql" for updateSql.
With 3.4.0, there is a new `--snapshotFormat=json` attribute you can pass to the snapshot command which will output the snapshot in machine-readable JSON.

{% highlight console %}
liquibase --url=jdbc:mysql://localhost/lbcat snapshot --snapshotFormat=json > snapshot.json
{% endhighlight %}

You can then use that snapshot with offline mode and any snapshot operations will use what is in the snapshot file as the database state.

- **liquibase --url=jdbc:mysql://localhost/lbcat --referenceUrl=offline:mysql?snapshot=path/to/snapshot.json diff** will compare the stored snapshot with the current database state
- **liquibase --url=offline:mysql?snapshot=path/to/snapshot.json diff --referenceUrl=offline:mysql?snapshot=path/to/older-snapshot.json diff** will compare two snapshots
- **liquibase --url=offline:mysql?snapshot=path/to/snapshot.json generateChangeLog** will generate a changelog based on what is in the snapshot
- **liquibase --url=jdbc:mysql://localhost/lbcat --referenceUrl=offline:mysql?snapshot=path/to/snapshot.json diffChangeLog** will generate a changelog based on what is new in the real database compared to what is in the snapshot.

### Changelog properties can be defined as local to the changelog, not global

Previously, changelog properties were "write once" and global. Meaning that once you define a property, it cannot be overridden and is applicable to all changelogs.

You can now use the `global="false"` flag in properties defined in a changeSet and the property will only apply to that changeLog.

{% highlight xml %}
<databaseChangeLog>
    <property name="varchar_type" value="NVARCHAR"/>
    <property name="boolean_type" value="BIT" global="false"/>
</databaseChangeLog>
{% endhighlight %}

The type varchar_type will be set to NVARCHAR across all changelog files, but the boolean_type value will only be BIT within this file and will be undefined elsewhere.

### Index descending can be more easily defined

Previously, if you wanted to control if an index is ASC or DESC you needed to use modifySql or just list the column name as "name DESC". There is now a "descending" boolean flag that can be specified in createTable and createIndex changes.

{% highlight xml %}
<createIndex tableName="my_table" indexName="my_index">
    <column name="registration_time"/>
    <column name="id" descending="true" />
</createIndex>
{% endhighlight %}

### Performance improvements

There was significant work done to improve snapshot time as well as loaddata. The metadata queries were improved and the amount of metadata that needs to be read for some operations was greatly decreased.

The larger your databases are, the more of an improvement you should see.

### New tagExists command

Are you wondering if you have already used a given tag? Use `liquibase tagExists tagName` to find out.
