## Liquibase 3.8.5 Bug Fix Overview

We've fixed a number of issues with this release. 

### Bug Fixes
For both Liquibase Community and Liquibase Pro users, the following bugs were fixed in version 3.8.5:

- Fixes issue in which Liquibase did not add `DESC` to an `id` column
- CLI once again accepts `sqlFile`, `delimiter`, `rollbackScript`, and `outputSchemaAs` arguments
- Fixes Stored Procedure whitespace impacting update calls
- Fixes `generateChangelog` failure when there are missing NOT NULL constraints
- Fixes `updateSQL`, which was not including schemaName for package bodies
- Fixes bug in which Liquibase was not always capturing `create package body` while generating changeLog
- Liquibase CLI now gives a more useful error message when an invalid character is passed to a command.
- Fixes an MSSQL issue, which threw an exception when doing diff/diffChangeLog between offline connections (such as when snapshotting json files)
- Fixes an MSSQL issue, which incorrectly generated `datetime` data type column when using`diff` & `diffChangeLog` Liquibase Maven plugin fails while executing/using "diff" and "generateChangeLog" with PostgreSQL)
