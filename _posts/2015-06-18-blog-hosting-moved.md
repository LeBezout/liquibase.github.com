# Liquibase Blog Hosting Has Moved

I've moved the blog hosting off a wordpress server and am now hosting it on GitHub along with the rest of www.liquibase.org.

All of the existing content on blog.liquibase.org has been moved over and reformatted. URLs to previous posts should be the same **except** for using www.liquibase.org as the host instead of blog.liquibase.org. Requests to blog.liquibase.org should automatically redirect to the new site.

For those subscribing to the RSS feed, the feed URL changed from blog.liquibase.org/feed to www.liquibase.org/rss.xml but I did set up a redirect which most readers will hopefully follow.

Finally, the new setup does not support blog comments. That is OK with me because I prefer people to use [forum.liquibase.org](http://forum.liquibase.org), [liquibase.jira.com](http://liquibase.jira.com) or even [@liquibase](https://twitter.com/liquibase) for discussion.

If you run into any problems with the conversion, let me know.
