# Liquibase 3.8.4 Released, Corrects Spring Boot Error in Pro

Liquibase 3.8.4 is now available here through [Liquibase.org](https://download.liquibase.org/download-community/).
The [3.8.4 release is also available on GitHub](https://github.com/liquibase/liquibase/releases/). Hereâ€™s a closer look at what's included in the latest release.

## Liquibase 3.8.4 Overview

### Liquibase 3.8.4 Fix for Liquibase Pro Spring Boot Error
Previously, running a Spring Boot application while using Liquibase 3.8.0+ in Java 9+ caused errors. With the release of Liquibase 3.8.4, users can now use primary workflows with embedded Liquibase cases.

### Bug Fixes
For both Liquibase Community and Liquibase Pro users, the following bugs were fixed in version 3.8.4:
- Fixed a 'Class not Found' exception error when using Java +9.
- Fixed a 'Cannot Use Default Schema Name' error when users diff against an SQL Server snapshot file.
- Fixed an 'Unexpected type: java.util.Date' error when using a defaultValueDate attribute in a YAML changelog.
- Improved datetime type handling in SQL Server. Liquibase now preserves types and prevents unexpected behaviors.
