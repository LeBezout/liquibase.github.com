# Liquibase 3.8.0 Released, Adds New Pro Features

Liquibase 3.8.0 is now available from [liquibase.org/download](http://liquibase.org/download) and through the Maven repositories. Release notes are available at [https://liquibase.jira.com](https://liquibase.jira.com).

Liquibase now comes in two modes:

* Liquibase Community
* Liquibase Pro

The 3.8.0 release adds the ability to enter a license key for a Liquibase Pro trial or full Liquibase Pro license.
 
### Liquibase Community

Liquibase is open source now and always. We’ll continue to provide the great Apache v2-licensed database change and version control tool you know and love. We’re excited to provide better documentation, better community support and more functionality for many future releases.

### Liquibase Pro

Liquibase Pro gives teams an option to get support and expert answers for their use case so they don’t have to go it alone. Liquibase Pro also adds functions to change sets for updating procedural database code. Liquibase Pro is available under a commercial license as a yearly subscription. A free 14-day trial is available. No credit card is required. [Learn more about Liquibase Pro](https://download.liquibase.org/)
