# New Liquibase Forum

If you visit <a href="https://liquibase.org/forum">https://liquibase.org/forum</a> you will notice that it looks completely different.  We were getting hit pretty hard with spam over the last few months on the old forum and I concluded that we could not stop it with the current simple machines software.  As a result, we have moved to a Zoho-based forum.


There were suggestions to simply go with Google Groups, but in the end Zoho provided question-tracking features I liked as well as the ability to import in all the old forum topics and so I went with them.


Please check out the new forum and let me know if you have any suggestions or questions on it.
