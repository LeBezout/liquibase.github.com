# Liquibase Talk at Percona Live

I'll be giving a talk at Percona Live in Santa Clara on April 3rd titled "*Liquibase: Source Control For Your Schema*".

It is a beginner-level course covering Liquibase basics plus some best practices. <a href="https://www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2014/sessions/liquibase-source-control-your-schema">More information</a>
