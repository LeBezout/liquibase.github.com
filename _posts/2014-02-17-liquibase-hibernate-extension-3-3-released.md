# Liquibase Hibernate Extension 3.3 Released

The Liquibase hibernate extension has been updated for both hibernate 3 and hibernate 4.

Major changes include:

- Support for Liquibase 3.1.1
- Support for Hibernate 4.3+ *NOTE: Due to hibernate incompatibilities, Hibernate 4.0-4.2 requires the use of the liquibase-hibernate4.2 extension*
- Support for compound primary keys
- Improved support for detecting auto-increment columns


See <a href="https://github.com/liquibase/liquibase-hibernate">https://github.com/liquibase/liquibase-hibernate</a> for more information and to download the 3.3 release.


The new versions are also working their way through the maven mirror system
