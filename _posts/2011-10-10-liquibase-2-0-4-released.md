# Liquibase 2.0.3 Released

2.0.3 is a very small update, mainly fixing the maven repository and the end of line char in the command line unix shell script.


Other bugs fixed are:


- Allow Changelog Parameters in raw SQL changesets and formatted SQL changelogs
- Sybase NUMERIC issue
- An issue with DB2 and defaultSchema
