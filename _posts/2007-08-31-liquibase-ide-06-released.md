# Liquibase IDE 0.6 Released

Version 0.6 of the Liquibase IDE and the Eclipse Plug-in have been released.  This version does not add new functionality, but does fix a showstopper bug that prevented the creation of change log files.

Information on downloading the new version is available on the <a href="https://download.liquibase.org/download-community/">download page.</a>
