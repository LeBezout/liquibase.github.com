# Liquibase 3.0 RC 2

It has taken longer to work through the remaining <a href="https://liquibase.jira.com/browse/CORE-902?jql=project%20%3D%20CORE%20AND%20fixVersion%20%3D%20%223.0.0%22%20AND%20resolution%20%3D%20Unresolved%20ORDER%20BY%20due%20ASC%2C%20priority%20DESC%2C%20created%20ASC">3.0 bug list</a> than I was hoping, and so do not have the 3.0 GA finished yet, but RC2 is now available.


### Changes since RC1 include:


- All automated tests now pass
- Diff support: Improved detection and handling of changed attributes, like data type size
- Several fixes for DB2, Oracle, Postgres, MySQL and HSQL
- DBDoc logic now working again
- Better cleanup of temp files and directories
- Whitespace and newlines are now not taken into account for `<sql>` checksums
