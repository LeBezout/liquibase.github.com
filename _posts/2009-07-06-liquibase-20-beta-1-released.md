# Liquibase 2.0 Beta 1 Released

Beta 1 of Liquibase 2.0 has been released. It can be downloaded from <a href="https://download.liquibase.org/download-community/">https://download.liquibase.org/download-community/</a>.


The main improvement over <a href="https://www.liquibase.org/2009/06/liquibase-20-milestone-1-released.html">milestone 1</a> is that it can be ran against existing changelog scripts, so it can be fully tested with existing databases.


Also, do not forget the <a href="https://www.liquibase.org/2009/06/liquibase-extension-contest-2009-now-underway.html">Liquibase Extension Contest</a> currently underway!
