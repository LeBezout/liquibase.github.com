# NetBeans Liquibase Plugin Available

For NetBeans users, there is a Liquibase plugin now available.


The current, 0.2 version implements rudimentary support and concentrates on the most needed functionality.


Features:


- Database connections stored in the Database Explorer plugin, so the developer doesn't have to separately maintain the registry of connections.
- Executing a changeset by simply selecting it in the File or Project explorer windows and call the execution from a context menu action. The database connection can be selected during the execution
- A formatted log is displayed in the Output Window about the execution of the changeset, so the developer is properly informed if the changeset execution has failed.
- Custom icon for the Liquibase changeset files, so they can better distinguished from the ordinary files.
