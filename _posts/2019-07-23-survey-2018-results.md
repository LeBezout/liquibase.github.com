# What We Learned from the 2018 Liquibase Community Survey

Last year, we invited the Liquibase community to take a survey to help us understand how Liquibase is used and how we can improve. 
A small sample size from our community (a little over 200 people out of 4M+ downloads in the past 12 months) participated via the Liquibase.org website. Here’s what we learned.

### Summing it up

* Liquibase is used by companies of all sizes. 
* Most Liquibase users find the tool useful and use extensions to meet their needs. 
* Although most users find the documentation helpful, we’d love to see that number higher than 68%. We’ll look at improving the documentation and providing links in more helpful places in the near future.

We also took the time to interview a handful of users to ask more in-depth questions to see what features they’re looking for. More on that soon. 

Thanks to all that participated in the survey and interviews! We look forward to making improvements and getting more feedback from the community.
