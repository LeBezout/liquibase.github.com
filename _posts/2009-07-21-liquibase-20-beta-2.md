# Liquibase 2.0 Beta 2

Liquibase 2.0 beta 2 is now available.  You can download it from <a href="https://download.liquibase.org/download-community/">https://download.liquibase.org/download-community/</a>.


There is no new major functionality yet, but lots of reorganized code and a plugin-framework that works with the command line.


Let us know if you have any issues with it.
