# Liquibase 3.5.3 Released

The issue that caused me to pull the 3.5.2 release turned out to be a false alarm.

Therefore, Liquibase 3.5.3 is now available from [liquibase.org/download](http://liquibase.org/download) and through the Maven repositories with no changes vs 3.5.2 besides a new version number.

Sorry for any inconvenience or concern.
