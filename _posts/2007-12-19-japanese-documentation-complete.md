# Japanese Documentation Complete

I would like to thank Yasuo Honda for all his hard work on the Japanese translation of the Liquibase documentation. He was also a great help in determining the best wiki tool to use to support translations.

If you are interested in assisting with translating the Liquibase documentation, feel free to edit the site wiki directly, or contact us.
