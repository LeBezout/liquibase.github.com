# Liquibase 3.8.7 Released

Liquibase 3.8.7 is now available here through [Liquibase.org](https://download.liquibase.org/download-community/). The [3.8.7 release is also available on GitHub](https://github.com/liquibase/liquibase/releases/). Hereâ€™s a closer look at what's included in the latest release.

## Liquibase 3.8.7 Overview

### More Targeted Rollback functionality for Liquibase Pro with 'rollbackOneUpdate' command
You asked, and we listened! With the release of Liquibase 3.8.7, Liquibase Pro users will now have additional rollback capabilities with the ability to roll back an entire set of changes in an update, without 
affecting all the other changesets which followed it. 

We even added a helper command `rollbackOneUpdateSQL`, which will show you the SQL that will be used in the `rollbackOneUpdate` command.

You can now also receive command specific help for Targeted Rollback by typing in either
`liquibase rollbackOneUpdate --help` or 
`liquibase rollbackOneUpdateSql --help`.

### Bug Fixes
