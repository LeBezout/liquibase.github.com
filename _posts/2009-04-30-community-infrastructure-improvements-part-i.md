# Community Infrastructure Improvements Part 1

Thanks to the generous people at Atlassian, we now have a much nicer issue tracker and source browser than before.  You can check out our Jira instance at <a href="https://liquibase.jira.com/projects/CORE/issues/?filter=allissues">http://liquibase.jira.com/browse/CORE</a>.


The issues were bulk moved from the sourceforge tracker, so I will be going over them to recategorize and prioritize them over the next week.


We also now have a message board at <a href="https://forum.liquibase.org/">https://forum.liquibase.org/</a> in place of the old liquibase-user, liquibase-devel, and liquibase-doc mailing lists.  A copy of all top-level (non-reply) posts are being forwarded to the mailing lists to help with the transition, but please use the forum from now on.


If you have any comments or suggestions on the new setup, please let me know.
