# Liquibase 3.8.6 Released

Liquibase 3.8.6 is now available here through [Liquibase.org](https://download.liquibase.org/download-community/). The [3.8.6 release is also available on GitHub](https://github.com/liquibase/liquibase/releases/). Here’s a closer look at what's included in the latest release.

## Liquibase 3.8.6 Overview

### Introducing Targeted Rollbacks for Liquibase Pro with 'rollbackOneChangeset' command
You asked, and we listened! With the release of Liquibase 3.8.6, Liquibase Pro users will now have additional rollback capabilities with 
[Targeted Rollback](/2020/02/targeted-rollback.html), a powerful new feature that allows you to target one changeset to rollback, without 
affecting all the other changesets which followed it. Think "git cherry pick" for rollbacks.

We even added a helper command `rollbackOneChangsetSQL`, which will show you the SQL that will be used in the rollbackOneChangeset command.

You can now also receive command specific help for Targeted Rollback by typing in either
`liquibase rollbackOneChangeSet --help` or 
`liquibase rollbackOneChangeSetSql --help`.

### GETTING_STARTED.txt
Included in the zip and tar files, you'll find a new GETTING_STARTED.txt file that points you to some sample projects to start trying Liquibase as quickly as possible.

### Bug Fixes
Liquibase 3.8.6 also continues our initiative to re-engage with our users by bringing new bug fixes to our Liquibase platform. For both Liquibase Community and Liquibase Pro users, the following bugs were fixed in version 3.8.6:
- `excludeObjects`& `includeObjects` parameters now works correctly when running `diff`.
- `dataOutputDirectory` parameter will now specify statement csv files appropriately.
- Updated default MySql driver to `com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver`.

### Documentation
All Liquibase users should also check out our continually improving documentation. For this release, checkout the new Targeted Rollback documentation here:

Full Liquibase documentation is available at [http://www.liquibase.org/documentation/index.html](/documentation/index.html).

### Roadmap
Look for these features in upcoming releases:
* `rollbackOneUpdate`, which will let you target all changesets in a given update, not just the most recent one.
* A Mac and Windows all-in-one installer that will get you running Liquibase Pro and Community in just a couple of clicks.
