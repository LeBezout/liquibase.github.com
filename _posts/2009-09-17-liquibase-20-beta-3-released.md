# Liquibase 2.0 Beta 3 Released

Liquibase 2.0 Beta 3 has been released. *Note: This is not yet production ready code and contains known issues*


The goal of the beta3 release is to provide a new stable release for entries in the <a href="https://www.liquibase.org/extensions">plugin contest</a> to build off of and for others who want to beta test the 2.0 release.


Major changes in the beta3 release include:


- Converting to Maven for our build process
- Major changes to the database snapshot functionality including better flexibility and performance
- Lots of bug fixes



Beta 3 should be the last "re-architecting" release. From now until the 2.0 final release we are going to focus on new features and bug fixes. The goal for 2.0 final is mid-September.



As always, let <a href="http://www.liquibase.org/forum">us know</a> if you have any questions or problems.
