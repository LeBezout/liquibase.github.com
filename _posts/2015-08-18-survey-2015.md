# Liquibase Survey 2015

One problem with running an open source project is that we don't really have "customers" to contact for feedback and product suggestions. I can always just add features that **I** think make sense, but one thing I've learned is that people use Liquibase in amazing ways I would never have imagined.

That is where the **[Liquibase survey](http://goo.gl/forms/TNXBl5GsPv)** comes in: it is your chance to provide feedback on how you use Liquibase and what is important to you so that I can better prioritize efforts over the next year.

## Your participation and time is greatly appreciated ##

### -----> [Liquibase Survey 2015 Form](http://goo.gl/forms/TNXBl5GsPv) <----- ###

If you know others that use Liquibase, please forward them the survey as well. Even better, if you know someone who is NOT using Liquibase, send them the survey as well.

The more information I can gather the better picture I will have.

**Survey runs until September 18th, 2015**
