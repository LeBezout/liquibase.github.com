# Liquibase 1.0 RC2 Released 

Liquibase 1.0 RC2 has been released. Changes since RC2 are primarily minor bug fixes.

The reason for having a RC2 rather than 1.0 final is that we changed exceptions thrown by some methods and want to make sure that change does not cause any unexpected problems.

Please report all bugs you find with the release candidate so they can be addressed in the 1.0 release, particularly in the Maven support.

Unless there are show-stopper bugs found, the final 1.0 release should be out next week.
