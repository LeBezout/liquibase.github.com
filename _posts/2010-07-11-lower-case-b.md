# Lover Case B

I was never a huge fan of the upper case B in "Liquibase" but had gone along with it since that was how it was. However, I've decided now that it bugs me too much, and so I am officially changing the product name to "Liquibase" with a lower case B.


I changed some of the documentation and all uses in the code. If you find a documentation page with the old capitalization, please fix it up.
