# Liquibase 2.0 RC3 Released

2.0 RC3 is now available. Like always, you can download it from the <a href="https://download.liquibase.org/download-community/">Liquibase download page</a>


RC3 includes:


- Bug fixes, including a change to how classes are loaded which should make it work better in application servers.
- The first 2.0 RC build that is pushed to the maven repository. We switched to pushing our jars to a new location, so if they don't sync with the central repository, let me know


The 2.0 features and 2.0 upgrade notes are still being added to.

As usual, <a href="https://liquibase.org/forum">let us know</a> if you have any questions or problems
