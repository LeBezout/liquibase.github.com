# Initial Liquibase IntelliJ IDEA Plugin Released

For you IntelliJ IDEA users out there, there is now a Liquibase plugin available through the Intellij plug-in manager.

- Like the Eclipse plugin, the IntelliJ plugin allows you to refactor your database like you refactor code using a "Refactor" context menu on database objects. These changes are automatically saved to a change log file.

- A "Liquibase" context menu on the database explorer allows you to migrate your database, roll back changes, generate documentation, and more.
- Additional refactoring and better documentation will be added in upcoming releases.
- As usual, <a href="https://www.liquibase.org/community/index.html">please let us know</a> if you have any questions or suggestions.
