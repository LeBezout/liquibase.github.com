# Liquibase 3.5.0 Released

Liquibase 3.5.0 is now available from [liquibase.org/download](http://liquibase.org/download) and through the Maven repositories. Question or comments can be directed [to liquibase.org/community](http://liquibase.org/community)

There has been a lot of work put into 3.5.0, including:

### Multi-schema snapshot and diff improvements

We have fixed up various bugs with how Liquibase handles snapshotting and comparing multiple schemas.

Beyond just bugfixes, you can also now specify mappings between source and target database schemas by using a new --referenceSchemas flag. I'll write more about this feature in a future blog post.

### OSGi support in liquibase-core

You no longer need to use the liquibase-osgi jar when running in an OSGi container. The standard liquibase.jar / liquibase-core module is all you need.

### New "context" attribute on include and includeAll to control when changelogs are included

If you specify the "context" attribute on include or includeAll, the referenced changelog files will only be executed if you are running under a matching context.

### Formatted SQL changelog improvements

We brought in some features from XML and YAML style changelogs to [formatted sql](http://liquibase.org/documentation/sql_format.html) including support for AND/OR context expressions and [changelog parameters](http://liquibase.org/documentation/changelog_parameters.html).

### New runOrder="first|last" attribute on changeSet to override where in the changelog it is ran

Sometimes you want a changeSet to always execute after everything else but don't want to keep moving it to the end of the changelog. Setting the runOrder will automatically move it in the final changeSet order.

### Improved SQL Parsing

Instead of using regular expressions to try to parse SQL, we now tokenize it using a grammer. This will make SQL parsing much less buggy and fixes a large set of bugs.

### Performance improvements and bug fixes

Always performance improvements and bug fixes

### Full Release Notes
