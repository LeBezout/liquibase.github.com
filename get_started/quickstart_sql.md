# Liquibase Tutorial: Getting Started Using SQL Scripts #

## Overview ##
This tutorial builds on the setup that is described in the [Quick Start](../quickstart.html).

## Step 1: Create a sql Folder ##

In the liquibase project folder that you created, create a <code class="explicit">sql</code> folder. This is the folder in which you will place SQL scripts that Liquibase will track, version, and deploy.

## Step 2: Setup the Change Log ##

This is a one-time step to configure a change log to point to the <code class="explicit">sql</code> folder that will contain SQL scripts. Create and save a file in the liquibase project directory you created. The file should be named <code class="explicit">myChangeLog.xml</code>. The contents of <code class="explicit">myChangeLog.xml</code> should be as follows:
{% highlight xml %}
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<databaseChangeLog
  xmlns="http://www.liquibase.org/xml/ns/dbchangelog"
  xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.liquibase.org/xml/ns/dbchangelog
         http://www.liquibase.org/xml/ns/dbchangelog/dbchangelog-3.1.xsd">

  <includeAll path="sql"/>
</databaseChangeLog>
{% endhighlight %}

## Step 2: Add a SQL Script to the sql Folder ##
With a <code class="explicit">liquibase.properties</code> file from the [tutorial setup](../quickstart.html) and the newly created <code class="explicit">myChangeLog.xml</code>, we are now ready to start adding SQL scripts to the <code class="explicit">sql</code> folder. Liquibase will order the scripts in the folder alphanumerically. Create a file named <code class="explicit">001_create_person_table.sql</code> with the following and save it in the <code class="explicit">sql</code> folder:
{% highlight sql %}
create table PERSON (
    ID int not null,
    FNAME varchar(100) not null
);
{% endhighlight %}

## Step 3: Deploy Your First Change! ##

We are now ready to deploy our first script! Open a terminal and run <code class="explicit">LB_HOME/liquibase update</code> if on a UNIX system or <code class="explicit">LB_HOME\liquibase.bat update</code> if on Windows.

## Step 4: Check Your Database ##

You will see that your database now contains a table called "PERSON". To inpsect the H2 database that is a part of the tutorial, open a terminal, navigate to the LB_HOME folder where you extracted the Liquibase <code class="explicit">*.zip</code> or the <code class="explicit">*.tar.gz</code> to and then to the lib subdirectory where the h2 driver jar is located. Run <code class="explicit">java -jar h2-1.4.199.jar</code>.<strong>Note: enter the specific version of the h2*.jar that you downloaded!</strong> Enter the JDBC URL, User Name, and Password from the <code class="explicit">liquibase.properties</code> file you created per the [tutorial setup](../quickstart.html). You will notice two other tables are created as well: "databasechangelog" and "databasechangeloglock". The databasechangelog table contains a list of all the changes that have been run against the database. The databasechangeloglock table is used to make sure two machines don't attempt to modify the database at the same time.
