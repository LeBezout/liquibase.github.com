# 1.x to 2.0 Upgrade Guide #

Liquibase 2.0 introduces several non-compatible changes that will require action 
to upgrade from 1.9 to 2.0.  Please update this wiki page with additional issues 
or work-arounds you find.  For a list of new features in 2.0, see the [2.0 features list](v2_features.html)

## Checksum Format Change ##
Liquibase stores checksums for each change executed in the DATABASECHANGELOG table.  
These checksums are used to alert the user to changeSets that have been changed after 
they were executed, and to handle runOnChange="true" changeSets.  

The way we compute these checksums changed in 2.0.  The first time you update an 
existing database, Liquibase will detect the old format and upgrade the checksum 
values.  During this first run, Liquibase will not be able to detect modified changeSets 
or runOnChange requirements.  If you are concerned about this, you may want to run a 
known unchanged changelog against the database with 2.0 before updating your new changelog.

## XSD Definition Change ##

The format of the XSD definition has changed.  The new format looks like:

    <databaseChangeLog
       xmlns="http://www.liquibase.org/xml/ns/dbchangelog"
       xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.liquibase.org/xml/ns/dbchangelog http://www.liquibase.org/xml/ns/dbchangelog/dbchangelog-2.0.xsd">


## ModifyColumn tag Deprecated ##

The modifyColumn tag has been deprecated and moved to the extension portal.  If you 
are using modifyColumn, consider the new `<modifyDataType`> or other more specific 
commands (addPrimaryKeyConstraint, etc).  You can continue to use the modifyColumn 
tag if you include modify-column-2.0.0.jar in your classpath.  See [modifyColumn library](http://liquibase.jira.com/wiki/display/CONTRIB/ModifyColumn+Change) to get this jar.

## Columns added to table DATABASECHANGELOG ##

Liquibase 2.0 will silently add three columns to your DATABASECHANGELOG table:  
Tag, OrderExecuted, and ExecType.  Older versions of Liquibase will be incompatible 
with this table because they will not supply values for these columns, two of which are not nullable.

SQL to manually make these changes is (may vary based on database):

    ALTER TABLE DATABASECHANGELOG ADD TAG VARCHAR(255);
    ALTER TABLE DATABASECHANGELOG ADD ORDEREXECUTED INT;
    UPDATE DATABASECHANGELOG SET ORDEREXECUTED = -1;
    ALTER TABLE DATABASECHANGELOG MODIFY ORDEREXECUTED INT NOT NULL;
    ALTER TABLE DATABASECHANGELOG ADD EXECTYPE VARCHAR(10);
    UPDATE DATABASECHANGELOG SET EXECTYPE = 'EXECUTED';
    ALTER TABLE DATABASECHANGELOG MODIFY EXECTYPE VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL;

You should only need to use the above sql for updateSql calls.

## Hibernate Integration Extracted ##

The Hibernate integration has been moved to be a plugin rather than in the Liquibase 
core itself.  If you use the Liquibase hibernate support, you'll need to add the jar 
from [the hibernate extension](http://liquibase.jira.com/wiki/display/CONTRIB/Hibernate+Integration) to your classpath.

## Diff parameter naming ##

To remove confusion, the baseUrl, baseUsername, etc parameters used in performing database diffs have changed to referenceUrl, referenceUsername, etc.

## Maven Plugin ##

The artifact name of the Maven plugin changed to "org.liquibase : liquibase-maven-plugin" from "org.liquibase : liquibase-plugin"

## Servlet Listener ##

* The class name of LiquibaseServletListener changed to liquibase.integration.servlet.LiquibaseServletListener.
* The context parameter names changed:
  * LIQUIBASE_DATA_SOURCE -> liquibase.datasource
  * LIQUIBASE_CHANGELOG -> liquibase.changelog
  * LIQUIBASE_CONTEXTS -> liquibase.contexts
  * LIQUIBASE_DEFAULT_SCHEMA -> liquibase.schema.default
  * LIQUIBASE_HOST_INCLUDES -> liquibase.host.includes
  * LIQUIBASE_HOST_EXCLUDES -> liquibase.host.excludes
  * LIQUIBASE_FAIL_ON_ERROR-> liquibase.onerror.fail




## Spring Integration ##

The class name of the SpringLiquibase class has changed to liquibase.integration.spring.SpringLiquibase

## Other package and class naming ##

Many other classes changed their packages and/or names significantly.  If you have 
more complex Liquibase integration and are not sure how to convert your code, post 
a question on the [forum](http://liquibase.org/forum)

## MANIFEST.MF requirements for embedding ##

Liquibase expects a Liquibase-Package property in a MANIFEST.MF file.  If you are 
using the standard liquibase.jar you don't have to worry about it. But if you are e
mbedding liquibase to the point of not including the standard MANIFEST.MF, make sure 
you add the following to your MANIFEST.MF

    Liquibase-Package: liquibase.change,
     liquibase.database,
     liquibase.parser,
     liquibase.precondition,
     liquibase.serializer,
     liquibase.sqlgenerator,
     liquibase.executor,
     liquibase.snapshot,
     liquibase.logging,
     liquibase.ext
