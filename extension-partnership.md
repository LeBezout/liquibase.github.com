# Extension Partnership

Let’s work together to get your database platform extension built into Liquibase! Here’s how to fast-track your extension to make sure we can include more database platform support into the core Liquibase community code for millions to enjoy. 

## Step 1: Build an awesome extension. 
- Your extension should be valuable to the community. [Learn more about how to contribute](https://liquibase.jira.com/wiki/spaces/CONTRIB/pages/2424883/Contributing).
- Make sure you have a public GitHub repository for your extension. ([Check out the SAP HANA Liquibase extension](https://github.com/SAP/hana-liquibase) for a great example of how to set this up.)
- Most importantly, make sure your extension works!

## Step 2: Contact us. 
Email <community@liquibase.org> and let us know you’ve built an extension. We’ll invite you to our Slack Workspace so we can collaborate easier. 

## Step 3: Automated testing.
We’ll let you know what types of automated testing need to be completed before adding it to the [main Github repository for Liquibase](https://github.com/liquibase/liquibase). 

After steps 1-3 are complete, we’ll continue to collaborate to get your extension into the core Liquibase code for all to use and enjoy. Have questions? Don’t hesitate to reach out to us. Email <community@liquibase.org>.
