# Using Liquibase with Hibernate

Liquibase works great with Hibernate. Support is provided through an extension, which
allows you to use your Hibernate configuration as a comparison database for diff, diffChangeLog and generateChangeLog.

To learn more about using Liquibase and Hibernate together, check out the [liquibase-hibernate extension at GitHub](https://github.com/liquibase/liquibase-hibernate) or
in the [liquibase-hibernate extension wiki](https://github.com/liquibase/liquibase-hibernate/wiki)
