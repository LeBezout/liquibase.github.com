## Extensions vs. Core

Liquibase is designed to support adding, enhancing, and overriding standard functionality through our extension framework.
Often times, the best way to add new functionality is to create a new extension or add to an existing one rather than modifying the base library.

For more information on how to write extensions, see [the extension portal](../extensions/index.html).
