# About Liquibase #
Nathan Voxland started the Liquibase project in 2006 to enable easier management of database changes, especially in agile software development environments. It’s open source and licensed under Apache 2.0.

Teams around the world trust Liquibase to easily track and deploy database changes. It’s even been built into solutions such as Spinnaker and Appian.
